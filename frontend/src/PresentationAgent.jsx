  // Q&A knowledge base for common hackathon questions
  const qaKnowledgeBase = [
    {
      question: "What makes your solution unique?",
      answer: "Our solution is unique because it combines multiple AI-powered learning modalities in one platform: real-time streaming content generation, personalized career coaching, skills forecasting, and team dynamics analysis. Unlike traditional LMS platforms, we provide instant, contextual learning experiences that adapt to individual needs and workplace scenarios."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI Career Coach work?",
      answer: "The AI Career Coach uses advanced language models to provide personalized career guidance. It analyzes user input about their goals, current skills, and challenges, then generates actionable advice, improvement strategies, and recommended resources. The coach maintains conversation context and can handle multi-turn discussions about career development."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the technical architecture?",
      answer: "We built a modern full-stack application with React frontend for the UI, FastAPI backend for AI processing, OpenAI integration for content generation, MongoDB for user-specific data persistence, and Firebase for authentication. The system uses real-time streaming responses similar to ChatGPT for an engaging user experience."
    },
    {
      question: "How scalable is your solution?",
      answer: "Our architecture is highly scalable. The FastAPI backend can handle concurrent requests efficiently, MongoDB provides horizontal scaling for data storage, and the modular design allows easy addition of new features. We can deploy on cloud platforms like Google Cloud Run for automatic scaling based on demand."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the business value for employers?",
      answer: "For employers, our platform reduces training costs by 60-80% through AI-generated content, improves employee engagement with personalized learning paths, accelerates skill development with targeted micro-lessons, and provides data-driven insights into team learning needs and performance."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure content quality?",
      answer: "We use advanced prompt engineering and content validation systems. The AI generates content based on proven learning methodologies, and we implement quality checks for accuracy, relevance, and educational value. Users can also provide feedback to continuously improve content quality."
    },
    {
      question: "What about data privacy and security?",
      answer: "We prioritize data security with Firebase authentication, encrypted data transmission, and user-specific data isolation. All personal learning data is stored securely in MongoDB with proper access controls. We comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure learning effectiveness?",
      answer: "We track learning progress through multiple metrics: completion rates, engagement time, quiz performance, skill application in simulations, and career advancement outcomes. The AI analyzes these patterns to continuously improve content and recommendations."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your go-to-market strategy?",
      answer: "We're targeting mid-size companies (100-1000 employees) who struggle with traditional training costs and effectiveness. Our initial focus is on tech companies and consulting firms. We plan to offer freemium trials, then subscription-based pricing with enterprise features."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you compete with existing LMS platforms?",
      answer: "Unlike traditional LMS platforms that offer static, one-size-fits-all content, we provide dynamic, AI-generated learning experiences that adapt in real-time. Our platform is more engaging, cost-effective, and personalized than solutions like Coursera for Business or LinkedIn Learning."
