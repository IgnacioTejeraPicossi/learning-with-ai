## ü§ñ I'm not just building a learning app ‚Äî I'm creating a co-evolving AI learning assistant where users shape its growth.



## Philosophy & Approach: Building with AI, Not Just Code

In this project, we intentionally chose a documentation-driven, AI-first approach to software development. Our goal was to demonstrate that, with the right architectural blueprints and explicit instructions, a modern AI system‚Äîsuch as Cursor AI‚Äîcan build a complex, full-stack application from scratch, even in environments where pre-existing code is not allowed.

**Why this approach?**

- **Adaptability to Constraints:**  
  Many hackathons and enterprise environments restrict the use of pre-written code or external repositories. By relying on comprehensive, step-by-step documentation, we ensure that the project can be built from the ground up, regardless of these constraints.

- **AI as a True Engineering Partner:**  
  We believe that the future of software engineering is not just about writing code, but about designing processes and systems that AI can understand and execute. Our documents are written to be both human- and machine-readable, enabling seamless collaboration between developers and AI agents.

- **Transparency and Reproducibility:**  
  Every architectural decision, configuration, and troubleshooting step is documented. This makes the build process transparent, auditable, and easy to reproduce‚Äîwhether by a human team or an automated system.

- **Demonstrating the Power of Modern AI:**  
  By challenging ourselves to build solely from documentation, we showcase how far AI tools like Cursor have come. This approach highlights the practical capabilities of AI in real-world, zero-code-start scenarios.

- **Onboarding and Knowledge Transfer:**  
  This methodology is not only valuable for hackathons, but also for onboarding new team members, scaling projects, and ensuring long-term maintainability. Anyone‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîcan pick up these documents and recreate the application with confidence.

**In summary:**  
This project is a proof of concept for the next generation of software development, where clear documentation and AI collaboration can achieve results previously possible only with direct code access. We invite you to explore, build, and extend this application‚Äîusing only the instructions provided‚Äîas a testament to what‚Äôs possible with today‚Äôs AI.

- We regularly review and incorporate new prompt patterns and techniques from [prompts.chat](https://prompts.chat) and its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts).
- This allows our application to continuously evolve, using the most effective prompt engineering strategies for better, more consistent AI results.
- In the future, we plan to automate prompt updates and allow user/admin feedback to help select and refine the best prompts for each feature.

**Learn more or contribute your own prompts at [prompts.chat](https://prompts.chat)!**

---

## Authentication: Google Sign-In with Firebase

The app supports secure, personalized access using **Google Sign-In via Firebase Authentication**.
- Users can sign in with their Google account to access all features.
- **User-specific data**: All saved lessons, career coach sessions, and skills forecasts are linked to the user's Google account.
- **Privacy and security**: Users can only access and modify their own data.
- Sign-in and sign-out are handled with Shoelace-styled buttons for a seamless UI.
- **Backend protection**: All API endpoints require valid Firebase authentication tokens.

---

## Database Architecture: Two Databases for Different Purposes

This project uses **two separate databases** for different purposes:

### 1. **Firebase Authentication Database**
- **Purpose**: User identity and authentication
- **Stores**: User credentials, email, UID, profile information
- **What you get**: Secure way to know "who is this user?"
- **Access**: Managed by Firebase (no direct database access needed)

### 2. **MongoDB (Application Database)**
- **Purpose**: Store your app's business data
- **Stores**: 
  - Micro-lessons with user associations
  - Career coach sessions per user
  - Skills forecasts per user
  - User progress and activity
- **What you get**: Your app's data with user associations
- **Collections**:
  - `lessons`: User-specific micro-lessons
  - `career_coach_sessions`: User's career coaching history
  - `skills_forecasts`: User's skills predictions
  - `teams`: User-created teams with metadata
  - `team_members`: Team member details and roles
  - `team_analytics`: AI-generated team analysis and insights
  - `users`: (Future) Additional user profile data

### **Why Use Both?**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication vs. business data
- **Firebase Auth is NOT a Database**: It only handles user identity, not app data
- **Scalability**: Each database optimized for its specific purpose
- **Security**: User data is properly isolated and protected

### **Data Structure Example:**
```json
// MongoDB lesson document
{
  "_id": "ObjectId(...)",
  "topic": "Agile sprint planning",
  "lesson": "Lesson content...",
  "user_id": "firebase_uid_here",
  "user_email": "user@example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

---

## User-Specific Features

### **Personalized Data Storage**
- **Micro-lessons**: Each user sees only their own saved lessons
- **Career coach sessions**: Conversations are saved per user
- **Skills forecasts**: Predictions are stored per user
- **Security**: Users can only access and modify their own data

### **New User-Specific Endpoints**
- `GET /user/career-sessions`: Retrieve user's career coaching history
- `GET /user/skills-forecasts`: Retrieve user's skills predictions
- All existing endpoints now filter by user ID

### **Frontend Integration**
- All API calls include Firebase authentication tokens
- User-specific data is automatically loaded
- Seamless personalization without additional user setup

---

## UI Styling: Shoelace Web Components

The app uses [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) for a modern, accessible, and consistent UI. Shoelace provides:
- **Cards** (`<sl-card>`) for feature panels
- **Buttons** (`<sl-button>`) for all actions (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
- **Utility classes and layout** for spacing and alignment
- **Theme support** for easy customization

**How to customize or extend:**
- Add more Shoelace components (dialogs, alerts, inputs) as needed
- Change themes or use Shoelace's utility classes for layout tweaks
- See [Shoelace documentation](https://shoelace.style/components/overview/) for more options

---

## Saved Micro-lessons

All micro-lessons generated by the user are automatically saved to the MongoDB database with user-specific associations. You can view your entire history of generated micro-lessons in the **Saved Micro-lessons** section at the bottom of the app. This allows you to revisit, review, and reuse any lesson at any time.

**Features of the Saved Micro-lessons section:**
- **User-specific**: Only shows lessons created by the logged-in user
- **Filter:** Instantly filter lessons by topic as you type.
- **Expand/Compress:** Toggle each lesson to show only the topic or the full lesson content.

## ‚ú® New Features

### Video Lessons
Enhance learning with short, focused video content followed by adaptive AI-generated quizzes. Users can:
- Paste a YouTube embed URL or MP4 link.
- Optionally paste a transcript/captions and auto-generate a summary.
- Generate a quiz based on the video summary using AI.
- Take the quiz, receive instant feedback, and earn a badge for high scores.
- Use cases: Soft skills, technical tutorials, compliance, and more.

### Interface-less UX (Zero-UI CommandBar)
A signature innovation: users can interact with the app using a single natural language input bar (‚ÄúAsk AI anything‚Ä¶‚Äù). The AI routes requests to the correct module, including:
- Concepts, Micro-lessons, Simulations, Recommendations, Certifications, Career Coach, Skills Forecast, Team Dynamics, and now Video Lessons.
- Example prompts:
  - ‚ÄúShow me a video lesson on Agile.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúGive me a micro-lesson on conflict resolution.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my next best skill to develop?‚Äù
- The app dynamically displays the right experience, reducing the need for manual navigation.

### Streaming LLM Responses (ChatGPT-like Experience)
All AI-powered features now stream their responses in real time, just like ChatGPT. Users see answers, lessons, recommendations, simulations, and quizzes appear word-by-word or chunk-by-chunk, dramatically improving perceived speed and engagement. This applies to:
- CommandBar (Interface-less UX)
- Micro-lessons
- Recommendations
- Scenario Simulations
- AI Career Coach
- Skills Forecast
- Certifications (Recommendations, Study Plan, Practice Test)
- Video Lessons (Summary & Quiz Generation)

This streaming-first approach makes the app feel fast, modern, and AI-native.

## Note: Two Backend Servers

This project uses **two backend servers**:

- **Python FastAPI backend** (main API):
  - Handles concepts, micro-lesson, recommendation, simulation, etc.
  - **Firebase authentication** for user security
  - **User-specific data storage** in MongoDB
  - Run with:
    ```bash
    uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
    ```
- **Node.js Express backend** (web search):
  - Handles `/web-search` endpoint using OpenAI's web search tool (if available)
  - Run with:
    ```bash
    cd websearch-backend
    node index.js
    ```

Your React frontend will call both as needed. This is a common pattern for hackathons and microservice architectures.

---

## Web Search Functionality: Tool Support and Fallback

The Web Search feature uses a separate Node.js backend to call OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model with the web search tool. **This tool is only available to some OpenAI users/organizations.**

- If your OpenAI account supports the web search tool (`web_search_preview`), you will get live, up-to-date answers from the internet.
- If not, the backend will **automatically fall back to a standard LLM response** (no web search, but still a high-quality answer).

### Summary Table: Web Search Tool Support

| Tool Parameter         | Supported? | Fallback Behavior                |
|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| `web_search`          | ‚ùå         | Falls back to standard LLM       |
| `web_search_preview`  | ‚ùì (beta)   | Falls back to standard LLM       |
| (no tools)            | ‚úÖ         | Standard LLM always works        |

- **Standard endpoints** (concepts, micro-lesson, recommendation, simulation) use the regular OpenAI API for fast, context-aware answers.
- **Web Search endpoint** uses GPT-4.1 with the web search tool if available, otherwise falls back to standard LLM.
- Both approaches work independently and do not interfere with each other.
